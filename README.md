### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a software engineer. My major tech stack is Back-End with `Golang` and I also use `Python` for automation and stuff. I have worked mostly on fintech applications, developing APIs and critical infrastructure components. Currently, I am working on telehealth veterinary platform where my roles include developing consumer portal APIs, writing unit & integration tests and thinking of unique ways to contribute for pet care.
